Changes:
Adjusted Spira to have a further ~16% longer duration. (it just wasn't powerful enough to be worth it over Axecline, it should now last 1/3 longer compared to Axecline)
Adjusted Spiras market value from 3 to 4 (same as Axecline, the difference will be their effects, not their cost)
Adjusted Axecline pain reduction from 75% to 72% (slight buff to keep it competitive against Spira)
