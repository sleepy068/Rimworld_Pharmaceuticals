Update v1.4.7 Build 24/05/23 | Post 27/05/23

Additions:
N/A

Changes:
Adjusted Flu Counteragent Overdose Severity Offset to 0.00 (wasn't meant to ever add to a OD, like other safe medical drugs)
Adjusted Raw Rimshroom Duration from 0.2 Days to 0.33 Days
Adjusted Rimshroom Tea Duration from 0.2 Days to 0.25 Days
Adjusted Hypercon tolerance gain per dose from 5% to 10% (This makes using the harder variants more attractive)
Adjusted Exoticon tolerance gain per dose from 10% to 5%
Adjusted Legicon tolerance gain per dose from 15% to 1.5%
Adjusted Epinephrine to have a Rest Fall Factor of 10% (meaning a pawn will have their rest drain reduced to 10% of what it is normally)
Adjusted Muse to now give +80% Rest
Adjusted Muse to now give a Rest Fall Factor of 50%
Adjusted Muse value from 49 to 79 (The new rest factors no longer makes it under powered, it actually feels decent now)
Adjusted Hunterkiller Addiction Change from 10% to 8%
Adjusted Sodest Addiction Chance from 3% to 2.2% (Same as Ashifer)

Localisation:
Changes to Muse description and ThoughtDef to reflect the new adjustments

Bug Fixes:
Fixed Spira Overdose typo resulting in a chance of 0.075% instead of 0.75%.
