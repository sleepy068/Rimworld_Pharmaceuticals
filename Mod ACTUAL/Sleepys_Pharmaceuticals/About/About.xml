[h2]Sleepy's Pharmaceuticals (v1.4.5)[/h2]
I absolutely love the drug mechanics in this game, they are highly risky but can turn the tide if used correctly. I am trying to replicate the feel vanilla drugs have (i play with very few mods and want to keep the balance). They will have niche uses and can help in tough situations but ultimately they will be risky to use.

I love to add content to this game that I feel is missing or that I'd like expanded. I figure that if I enjoy what I've added, others may too so I to post my mods to the workshop. Balance is critical to me as I am a vanilla player and I'll try to ensure nothing is unbalanced but ultimately I have a goal in mind for the content I am adding so what I consider balanced may not always be what you'd consider balanced. Hopefully you enjoy the mod none the less.

[b]Roadmap:[/b]
- This mod is consider feature complete and will not likely have more content added (I feel like my mod has done what I set out to do and added various new niche drugs and drug profit options, further content would likely just be repetition or add little value to the game).
- Balancing where needed.

[img]https://i.imgur.com/YySbEPN.png[/img]
[b]On Going Games:[/b]
- Safe to add to an ongoing game
- It will cause issues if removed from an existing save (consider starting a new game to see if you are happy with the content). You can try destroying all the content added but I'd be worried existing addictions might cause problems with world pawns.

[b]Compatibility[/b]
- My mod does not override any core content so should be compatible with most if not any mods that change the medical system, override drugs or add drug content.

[b]Integrated Compatibility:[/b]
None at the moment (hasn't been necessary).

Please post any issue reports to my Github. I appreciate any feedback but please keep in mind I have a goal in mind for the content I am adding so what I consider balanced may not always be what you'd consider balanced.
