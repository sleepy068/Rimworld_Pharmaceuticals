[h2]Sleepy's Pharmaceuticals (v1.2.1)[/h2]
I absolutely love the drug mechanics in this game, they are highly risky but can turn the tide if used correctly. I am trying to replicate the feel vanilla drugs have (i play with very few mods and want to keep the balance). They will have niche uses and can help in tough situations but ultimately they will be risky to use.

Feedback and suggestions are appreciated! Especially if anything feels overpowered.

[b]Roadmap:[/b]
- Add mod options (so you can cherry pick the mod).
- Add lots more pharmaceuticals from medical, social and hard drugs (i'll be adding away until I feel the mod adds enough to fill the gaps I believe are in the game, i'll avoid bloat, clones or repeat style additions).
- Balancing where needed.

[b]On Going Games:[/b]
- Safe to add to an ongoing game
- It will cause issues if removed from an existing save (consider starting a new game to see if you are happy with the content). You can try destroying all the content added but I'd be worried existing addictions might cause problems with world pawns.

[b]Compatibility[/b]
- My mod does not override any core content so should be compatible with most if not any mods that change the medical system, override drugs or add drug content.

[b]Integrated Compatibility:[/b]
None at the moment (hasn't been necessary).
