Additions:
N/A

Changes:
Nanites Possession Count changed from null to 5 (trying to make these appear a bit more, I've honestly never really seen anyone have them in game)
Nanites Exotic Misc tag removed (hopefully to help it show up more, as common as neutroamine with traders at least).

Localisation:
N/A

Bug Fixes:
Technica was setup as an eaten/consumed drug instead of an injecting drug, despite the graphic suggesting the latter (fixed).
