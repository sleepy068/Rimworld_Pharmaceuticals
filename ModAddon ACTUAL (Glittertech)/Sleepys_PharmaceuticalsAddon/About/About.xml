[b]Dependencies:[/b]

[b]On Going Games:[/b]
- Safe to add to an ongoing game
- It may cause issues if removed from an existing save (consider starting a new game to see if you are happy with the content). The game will delete all the content added and give a one time error but I'd be worried existing addictions might cause problems with world pawns.

[b]Compatibility[/b]
- My mod does not override any core content so should be compatible with most if not any mods that change the medical system, override drugs or add drug content.

[b]Integrated Compatibility:[/b]
None at the moment (hasn't been necessary).

Please post any issue reports to my Github. I appreciate any feedback but please keep in mind I have a goal in mind for the content I am adding so what I consider balanced may not always be what you'd consider balanced.
