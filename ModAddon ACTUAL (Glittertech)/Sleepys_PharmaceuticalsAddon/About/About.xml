[h2]Sleepy's Pharmaceuticals - Glitterworld Medicine (v1.0.0)[/h2]
A standalone additional to my Sleepy's Pharmaceuticals mod. I love the drug mechanics in this game but I wanted to be able to have more late game drug options.

I love to add content to this game that I feel is missing or that I'd like expanded. I figure that if I enjoy what I've added, others may too so I to post my mods to the workshop. Balance is critical to me as I am a vanilla player and I'll try to ensure nothing is unbalanced but ultimately I have a goal in mind for the content I am adding so what I consider balanced may not always be what you'd consider balanced. Hopefully you enjoy the mod none the less.

You can find the stats of all drugs added by Sleepy's Pharmaceuticals - Glitterworld Medicine here:

[b]Roadmap:[/b]
- Balancing.

[b]Dependencies:[/b]

[b]On Going Games:[/b]
- Safe to add to an ongoing game
- It may cause issues if removed from an existing save (consider starting a new game to see if you are happy with the content). The game will delete all the content added and give a one time error but I'd be worried existing addictions might cause problems with world pawns.

[b]Compatibility[/b]
- My mod does not override any core content so should be compatible with most if not any mods that change the medical system, override drugs or add drug content.

[b]Integrated Compatibility:[/b]
None at the moment (hasn't been necessary).

Please post any issue reports to my Github. I appreciate any feedback but please keep in mind I have a goal in mind for the content I am adding so what I consider balanced may not always be what you'd consider balanced.
